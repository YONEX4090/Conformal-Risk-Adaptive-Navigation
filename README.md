# Conformal Risk-Adaptive Navigation for Mobile Robot in Crowded Environments
In this paper, we propose Conformal Risk-Adaptive Model Predictive Control (CRA-MPC), the first method combining probabilistic ensemble learning with online adaptive conformal calibration to achieve real-time safety boundary adjustment in dynamic crowds. Our hierarchical framework integrates a Probabilistic Ensemble Neural Network (PENN) for long-horizon waypoint selection with an Adaptive Conformal Unit (ACU) for
short-term safety calibration, feeding uncertainty estimates into dynamic control barrier functions within risk-adaptive MPC.
